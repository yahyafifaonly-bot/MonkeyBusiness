========================================
UPDATE WORKFLOW TO ENABLE BACKTEST
========================================

The backtest job didn't run because of a condition issue.

UPDATED FILE: UPDATED_DEPLOY_WORKFLOW_v2.yml

TO FIX:
1. Go to: https://github.com/yahyafifaonly-bot/MonkeyBusiness/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
2. Click the pencil icon to edit
3. Copy the entire content from UPDATED_DEPLOY_WORKFLOW_v2.yml
4. Paste it into the GitHub editor (replace everything)
5. Commit the changes

WHAT CHANGED:
Line 190: Simplified the backtest trigger condition
Now it will run backtest on EVERY push to main (whenever strategies change)

After you update, push any change to Strategy1_EMA_RSI.py and the backtest will run automatically.
