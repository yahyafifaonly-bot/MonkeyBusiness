SIMPLE FIX FOR WORKFLOW ERROR
========================================

There's an indentation error on line 190 of the workflow file.

STEPS TO FIX:

1. Go to: https://github.com/yahyafifaonly-bot/MonkeyBusiness/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml

2. Click the pencil icon to edit

3. Find line 190 (around line 190, look for "backtest-strategy1:")

4. It currently looks like this:
```yaml
  backtest-strategy1:
    name: Backtest Strategy1_EMA_RSI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.event_name == 'push'    <-- WRONG (2 spaces)
```

5. Change it to this (add 2 more spaces before "if"):
```yaml
  backtest-strategy1:
    name: Backtest Strategy1_EMA_RSI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push'  <-- CORRECT (4 spaces)
```

6. Commit the change

That's it! The backtest will then run automatically.
